## Project Description

This project showcases a travel diary of an author who displays his/her travel experiences. The blog author has access to all his/her blogs and can create and update blogs in the navigation bar. The homepage will display the most current blog the author created.

To render the data from the travel journal API I built on the back-end, jQuery is utilized to work in conjuntion with the API to create a friendly one-user blog. The project is hosted on Netlify platform, and can be viewed [here](https://klee-ga-project02.netlify.app/).
